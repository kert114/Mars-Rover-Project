if you want to clone this git repository  - git clone and then the link.

Put this link into your command line, or you can go on VS code and paste the link in. When you first download VScode you'll see an option to "clone git repository". 


To commit to to the repo, there's an option on VS code or you can use the command line: git comit -m "your message" 
then: git push

you need to pull before you push: git pull
if you get conflicts, then yeah.
