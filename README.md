if you want to clone this git repository  - git clone and then the link. 
The link is found by clicking the code and then copying the url. 

Put this link into your command line, or you can go on VS code and paste the link in. When you first download VScode you'll see an option to "clone git repository". 


To commit to to the repo, there's an option on VS code or you can use the command line: 
git add then_name_of_file/directory
git commit -m "your message" 
then: git push


you need to pull before you push: git pull
if you get conflicts, then yeah.
