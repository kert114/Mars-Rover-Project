So the miniserver portal is receiving stuff from the control and then uploading it into the database in the cloud. 
At the same time, it also queries that data and send it back to the codejs file - though this part isnt complete yet. 

Control to command is basically part of the control unit - it sends information to the command unit in a format. That's all.
